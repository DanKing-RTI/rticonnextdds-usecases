rticonnextdds-usecases
======================

This repository contains examples that implement a variety of DDS use cases. 
These use case examples should be a stepping stone for creating real 
distributed applications based on RTI Connext DDS. Additional information 
about each use case can be found at www.rti.com/resources/usecases/index.html 
and in the Docs/ directory of the individual use case examples.

The examples in this repository are meant to illustrate simplified real-world 
uses of the RTI Connext DDS product, focusing on:
- How to model data in IDL for each specific use case
- How to tune QoS for use-case-specific requirements such as scalability, latency, or throughput
- How to create applications with both DataWriters and DataReaders
